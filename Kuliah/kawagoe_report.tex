	\textbf{Problem :}
	We want to find 4-edges knot possible condition for 3 and 1 coloring. We try every combination of coloring for each crossing to find which one is satisfy the condition for 3 and 1 coloring. \\ \\
	\textbf{Answer :}
	In the figure 2 we try to find all the combination of 3 coloring and 1 coloring. It is shown that $ 4_{1} $ is not 3 colorable. \\ \\We can label the strand with $ 1,2,3,4 $. We assume strand $ 1,2,3 $ have different color. Say 1 is black, 2 is blue, 3 is red. Then, to color the strand 4 we should choose the color which is satisfy the coloring of knot. But, it is impossible to choose any color that acceptable. Such knot is not 3 colorable. This knot is only possible for three of 1 coloring, which is all strand is black, blue, or red.\\ \\
	\underline{So, we could only found three 1-colorable.} Which is all black, blue, or red.

	In figure 2, we could show that the crossing which not satisfy the coloring of knot by green neon highlighter.
